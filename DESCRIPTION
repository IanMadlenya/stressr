Description: Forms queries to submit to the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank web
    site's financial stress index data site.  Provides query functions for both the composite stress index and the components data.
    By default the download includes daily time series data starting September 25, 1991.  The functions
    return a class of either type easing or cfsi which contain a list of items related to the
    query and its graphical presentation.  The list includes the time series
    data as an xts object.  The package provides four lattice time series plots
    to render the data in a manner similar to the bank's own presentation.
